### Configuration/Environment variable changes:

In this release, we have deprecated the `Sunbird Learning service`, including an API that was previously served by this service. We have relocated this API to the `Sunbird content service`. Consequently, we need to update the Kong file to ensure that the upstream URL for the license validation API (`asset/v3/validate`) points to the `Content service` instead of the `Learning service`.

### Breaking changes (The existing features will break the if we donâ€™t do the below actions):

During the upgrade to version 5.7.0, it is essential to ensure that the mentioned services and environments are properly updated. Previously, the APIs mentioned were part of the sunbird-learning-service, but now they have been moved to the content-service without altering the API contract. Additionally, changes have been made to ensure that these APIs are no longer served from the sunbird-learning-service.&#x20;

Therefore, it is crucial to verify that the necessary updates are implemented correctly for a smooth transition to version 5.7.0.

**List of APIs moved to Content Service:**
