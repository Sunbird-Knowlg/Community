### Shallow copy of a collection

A collection can also be reused (adopted) by creating a shallow copy of the collection. When a shallow copy is created, the hierarchy of the original collection is not modifiable in the shallow copy. Only the metadata such as name, description, icon etc. of the shallow copy is modifiable. Any change to the hierarchy of the original collection automatically reflects in the shallow copy.
