# DIAL Service

DIAL refers to _Digital Infrastructure for Augmented learning_. Sunbird Knowlg uses the [DIAL spec](https://github.com/sunbird-specs/DIAL-specs/blob/main/README.md) to power the phygital discovery of assets. It provides tools for DIAL code management. The DIAL powers the discovery of digital resources using physical artefacts like QR codes, can be extended to other physical artefacts. The DIAL code does the loose binding of digital assets with physical artefacts.&#x20;

In practice, physical artefacts will be published once, serving as coordinate to the discovery of digital resources. Digital resources can be published and modified later multiple times, this is done to improve digital resources. In short, the DIAL code serves as a coordinate for digital resources discovery, where the digital resources can be modified, improved and personalised at runtime.

### DIAL code usage workflow

* DIAL code acts as a bridge between physical and digital artefacts
* DIAL code is generated and linked to a folder in a collection
* User scans the DIAL code and accesses all the linked assets in that folder
* This enables easy extension and modification of assets accessed through a DIAL code
