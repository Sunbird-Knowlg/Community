# Media APIs

The media APIs are also part of the content-service. All the API's specific to media (image, audio, video, file) are exposed as part of the content-service itself. These media files are always stored in the blob/cloud to be accessed publicly by mobile/web.

{% hint style="info" %}
Moving out the media-service as an independent service from content-service is planned as part of the roadmap.
