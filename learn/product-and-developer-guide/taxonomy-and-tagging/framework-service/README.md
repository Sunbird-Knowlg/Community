# Framework Service

Taxonomy Framework powers the knowledge arrangement as per domain. The Framework enables this by providing the ability to tag an asset with attributes required by the domain.

Domain-specific tagging ensure the tagging enables at asset is relevant and helps in assets discovery by navigation and search.

Take an example of school education, assets created for K-12 can have taggable attributes like BOARD, GRADE, MEDIUM and SUBJECT. Users can search assets based on Grade, Medium Subject or Board, Or they can Navigate to relevant assets starting from Board -> Grade -> Medium-> Subject. This will narrow down the asset at each level and ensure only relevant assets are given to users.
