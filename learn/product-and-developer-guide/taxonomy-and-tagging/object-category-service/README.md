# Object Category Service

### Category

This represents the actual items that are defined and created based on different use cases. Unlike an Asset, which is a core entity of the system, a category is just a “label” tagged to an Asset and defines and configure a specific set of properties and behaviours. These properties are a subset of those supported by the asset. Hence, categories are completely driven by configuration, without any category-specific logic implemented in the code.

Example from education - Exam Question paper, Practice Worksheet, Quiz each one is a category of the asset type Question set Analogous example from the real-world - A Shoe, Sandal, Flip-flops each one is a category of the asset type footwear Following pages provide details of the various types of asset that are part of sunbird and a default set of categories configured.
