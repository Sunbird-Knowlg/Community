# Rich and Diverse Assets

### Assets

This is the master definition for types of items that are supported on Sunbird.\
Example from education - _**Question set**_ is an asset\
Analogous example from the real-world - A _**foot wear**_ is an asset

An asset is the core system entity through which any type of asset is managed. Services such as creation, modification, publishing, discovery, consumption - are built around the core assets.

Knowlg provides a generalized and externalized asset model as shown in the below diagram.

### **Key Capabilities of Sunbird Assets:**

* **Enables you to define your own domain specific assets and their properties using configurable and extensible attributes.**

Below assets are currently defined in Sunbird. You can define new assets basis your needs.

a) Content - This asset allows you to create a variety of content enabling you to deliver rich learning experiences.

b) Collections - click [here](organised-collections.md) to know more about this asset type

c) Question(s) - click [here](http://127.0.0.1:5000/o/-Mi9QwJlsfb7xuxTBc0J/s/Wu4HIWGkb7dD4y0Kup4W/) to know more about this asset type

d) Question Set - click [here](http://127.0.0.1:5000/o/-Mi9QwJlsfb7xuxTBc0J/s/Wu4HIWGkb7dD4y0Kup4W/) to know more about this asset type

* **Enables creation of categories to cater to domain specific solutions through configuration without any code changes.**

Unlike an **Asset**, which is a core entity of the system, a category is just a “label” tagged to an object and can defined a specific set of properties and behaviors - which are a subset of those supported by the asset.

Hence, categories are completely driven by configuration, without any category specific logic implemented in the code.

Example from education - _**Exam Question paper, Practice Worksheet, Quiz**_ each one is a category of the asset type **Question set.**\
Analogous example from the real-world - A _**Shoe, Sandal, Flip-flops**_ each one is a category of the asset type **foot wear.**

* **Provides rich and customizable tagging frameworks to efficiently organize your assets and help users discover relevant assets.**

* **Provides tools such as editors and players to create and consume these assets.**
